# **App Name**: SmokeGenius

## Core Features:

- Smoke Simulation: Realistic Smoke Simulation: Implement a WebGL-based smoke simulation to generate realistic smoke effects, possibly using libraries like Three.js or custom shaders. Users can adjust smoke density, color, and movement.
- Smoke Customization: Customizable Parameters: Provide controls to adjust various parameters of the smoke, such as density, color, direction, and velocity, enabling users to create diverse smoke effects.
- In-Browser Recording: Recording Functionality: Allow users to record the smoke simulation directly in the browser, capturing it as a video or a series of images using browser APIs like MediaRecorder.
- Export Animation: Export Options: Offer options to export the recorded smoke animation in various formats such as MP4, GIF, or a sequence of PNG images.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Dark, neutral gray (#333333) to emphasize the smoke effects.
- Smoke Colors: Allow a wide range of selectable colors from a color picker with gradient support.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements like buttons and sliders.
- Full-screen simulation view with controls docked at the bottom or side, ensuring an immersive experience.
- Clean and modern font for UI elements, ensuring readability.
- Use minimalist, intuitive icons for controls such as 'Record,' 'Export,' and smoke parameter adjustments.
- Subtle transitions and animations for UI elements to provide feedback on user interactions.
